# Chatroom Express API
This application works as a server, storing user and chat resource data in conjunction with a client facing chat application. This program enables users to Post, Patch, Delete, and Index Resources.

---

### Planning Strategy
Setting up the server was relatively easy compared to building the client facing application. As a team, we constructed an ERD to visualize our resources and we were able to program pathways to manage chat resources within the first two days of work.

We decided to produce a minimal viable product before completing the Socket Middleware but still managed to establish a Socket Connection and Disconnect linked to the Chat Index CRUD Action.

#### Technologies Used
- Express
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- Socket.IO

---

#### Unsolved Issues
- In the time allotted, we were not able to fully integrate Sockets into our application, so it is currently more of a messaging board. We would like to emit Chat Resource CRUD events to all logged in users.

 - We are also interested in establishing another resource to group Chats into Chat Rooms.
